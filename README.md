## Functions
* Flexible Combat Control: The plugin enables dynamic management of the PvP mode in the lobby. Players can activate this mode by selecting the sword set in the configuration.
* Customizable Countdown: The countdown duration before combat begins is configurable. In the configuration file, you can set how many seconds the countdown should last before players can start fighting.
* Fight Synchronization: The plugin ensures fight synchronization among players who have activated the PvP mode. This ensures all participants are in the same combat cycle.
* Anti-Abuse Safeguards: To prevent abuse, the plugin checks whether all participants in the fight have activated the PvP mode. Combat is initiated only when both players are ready.
* Blocked Commands During Combat: To ensure fairness and avoid situations where players might attempt to escape to other servers, the plugin prevents the execution of commands during combat.
* Customized Messages: There's an option to customize messages and announcements displayed to players during the activation of the combat mode and throughout the fight.
* Sound Effects: The plugin introduces additional auditory experiences. Sound has been added to scrolling through the hotbar, and a sound effect accompanies the countdown before combat.
